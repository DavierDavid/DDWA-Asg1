# Database

Database is a content management system that will allow the users to check their details and infomations.
 
## Design Process
 
The webpage is designed for everyone to use, so it is has a straight forward layout with a simple yet striking color scheme. 
Users will find this layout very easy to use and should have no problem navigating around.

The design, i went with a very simple fixed nav bar, so users can logout easily after checking on their infomations.
Same goes for the menu, it is fixed on the left.

Colors used:
#0D2C54, #EDF4FC, #ECC05B
